# Train a smartcab how to drive

This is a project based on reinforcement learning, specifically using Q-learning technique.

It is one of the mandatory projects in Udacity's machine learning engineer nano degree program.

In this project, I've written a python program to simulate an automated driver that learns from the experience how to follow the traffic rules and the navigator using Q-learning technique without being explicitly taught.

# Dependencies

This project requires Python 2.7 with the pygame library installed:

# Run

Make sure you are in the top-level `smartcab` directory. Then run:

```python smartcab/agent.py```

OR:

```python -m smartcab.agent```
